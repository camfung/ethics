topic: The ethics of soft hacking

dilemma:
- Option 1: Should an individual that gains access to a sass through a backdoor exploit use it and not tell anyone?
- Option 2: Should an individual report the bug event though they would lose free access to the exploit?

thesis:
- Option 1: An indivisual should report an exploit that they find even though they have access to the free service.
