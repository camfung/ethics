relativism
- cultural, ethical, normative relativism is the one we are talking about
- "normative" = what we should do(has rules)
- the moral beliefs of the culture you are in determine what is right and wrong for you
- example: 
	- Canada in 1860, suicide is morally wrong are imprisoned for attempting it
	- Japan in 1860, suicide can be morally required
- two different rules/norms
- relativism believes they can both be true together
- one person telling another from another culture that they are wrong is wrong (if the action is in alignment with their culture) according to relativism
- an immigrant will have to change their norms

argument against relativism: we can't critique ourselves/others, but that is the basis of morality
- also, hard to define boundaries of a culture, there are subcultures, maybe don't belong to one clear culture
- values of culture at a whole: majority? this is unclear and hard to argue, some beliefs can be a 50/50 split

Objectivism believes that there are objective truths that can potentially be discovered using the right techniques independent of relativistic stances
- there is a correct answer (we can be wrong)


utilitarianism problems
- in some circumstances: throw people under the bus for the greater good
- disregards fairness or rights
- everything serves at the altar of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain
- indicator that something is wrong if we can argue for killing innocent people
- people themselves don't matter, just how happy they are
