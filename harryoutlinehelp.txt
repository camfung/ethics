Make an argument for one of the "horns"

- consider the relativist position
- reject the relativist position
- argue for objectivism
- provide objectivist argument for the thesis
- discuss utilitarianism
- consider an objection to your argument
- write as simple/straightforward way as possible



- no 3-5 paragraph essay: not well set up
 - Thesis, bestEvidence, secondBest, thirdBest, Conclusion
 - won't work cuz we need an objection

- possible strategy: eliminate the competition, argue against alternatives can be very effective
- explain things like utilitarianism in one simple sentence to summarize it (don't need to cite)
- if we want to use a specific argument from someone's work (E.g. Stuart Mills), then we need citation

we need six parts, need more than six paragraphs

One way to write this (easier, less efficient):

PART 1 
Intro:
- topic, dilemma, thesis


PART 2
Part 2,paragraph one: 
- Here is what a relativist would recommend and why they would recommend it
- explain relativism


Part 2,paragraph two:
- relativism is wrong, actually
- "here's why": can steal from Vasco's slides
- explain what objectivism is
- here is my objectivist argument


PART 3: Objectivist argument

Path 1: pick a moral principle to argue using it
- 

path 2: Utilitarianism says * because
- have to explain utilitarianism


PART 4: The objection, the opposition argument
 - if we pick path 1, we have to stay on 1, same with path 2

Path 1:A utilitarianist objection 
 -
