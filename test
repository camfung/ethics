an objectivist would view the situation with the belief that this is not a clear moral wrong. although being an objectivist doesnt mean that they have any specific set of moral values. it just means that they think that there is some set of values that is always correct everywhere this doesnot mean that anyone has to know or believe them 
the key flaw to the relatavists position of alexes actions is that alex gets to decide what his culture is. there is no clear distinction of what your culture is. 
this means that alex can decide that his culture is that of the hackers that he associates with. and of course within that group the culture of accessing a paid tool for free is more of a badge of honor instead of a immoral action.

a relativist would speak to alex about his culture and understand what is accepted among the peers of alex. they would reccomend that alex do what would be socially accepted in alexs culture. this means that alex gets to decide what part of his culture he wants to think about and he can do what he wants depending on which part of his culture he chooses.
